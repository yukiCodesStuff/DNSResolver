# DNS Resolver
This is a basic DNS resolver done using C++.

## Usage
In order to run the program, run the following in command line:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the repo location through the command line.
2. Run `make clean` to clean the repo.
3. Run `make all` to compile.
4. Run `./Driver [LookUp IP] [DNS Server IP]`.

Some basic tests can be ran if you do not have a Look Up IP or DNS server IP readily available, check makefile for tests.
