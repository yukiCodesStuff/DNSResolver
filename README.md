# DNS Resolver
This is a basic DNS resolver done using C++.

## Usage
In order to run the program, run the following in command line:
<ol>
<li>Clone repository and navigate to repo location through command line</li>
<li>```make clean``` to clean repo</li>
<li>```make all``` to compile</li>
<li>```./Driver [LookUp IP] [DNS Server IP]```</li>
</ol>

Some basic tests can be ran if you do not have a Look Up IP or DNS server IP readily available, check makefile for tests.
